    "Our goal for the summer is to pull together the threads and loose ends of previous work. Those threads include:\n",
    "1. A presentation and collaboration platform for our work that can be a model for other similar projects\n",
    "2. Wikidata as part of the KSR data ecosystem (contributing to and pulling from)\n",
    "3. Making recommendations to lawmakers for making policies and inventories computational (machine readable)\n",
    "4. Making California Law Enforcement policies accessible and useful to citizens\n",
    "5. Making Military Equipment Inventories more visible and understandable to citizens\n",
    "6. Connecting siloed data to show relationships between past injustices and present harm as well as showing the positive change resulting from activism and civic engagement\n",
    "7. \"Humanizing the harm rather than [just] presenting cold, dead statistics\""

It is a flexible platform that can take content from Jupyter notebooks, Observable, R, Plotly, etc. and output to a website hosted by github, slide presentations, and print-ready articles. \n",
    "2. **Establishing data visualization tools and pipelines.** KSR data comes from heterogenous sources. That means that we need to be able to access and integrate data stored in different systems. We need to visualize data created by activists and stored in Google Sheets. We need to access community-constructed data in Wikidata and data we have created that is stored in github, the Stanford Digital Repository, and Redivis. "
