The KSR Data Lab develops data-driven experiments in support of the [Know Systemic Racism project](https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2021/08/introducing-know-systemic-racism-ksr-project). The central goal of the Know Systemic Racism project is to demonstrate, through data, that systemic racism exists. The project is focused on California and intends to be a model for other libraries in other states in the US to extend the work.

The Data Lab is interested in developing data architectures that are community-based, well-documented, and integrated with existing projects.
